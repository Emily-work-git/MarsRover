### ORID Report - Emily ###

#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today we explored the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD), including its purpose and advantages. We learned how to write unit tests and discussed best practices for implementing TDD effectively.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I found TDD to be quite beneficial as it creates a safety net for code changes and reduces the effort required for manual verification of results. However, I also experienced some frustration with the process. Writing only the minimal code necessary to satisfy a test case felt tedious and somewhat burdensome.

#### Interpretive: Why?
TDD serves as a safety net for code changes, helping to save time on manual verification. I think it is particularly useful in CI/CD environments and fosters collaboration among team members by ensuring that new changes do not compromise existing, functional code. Additionally, TDD encourages a deeper understanding of requirements before implementation. However, I think the practice of writing just enough code to pass tests is tedious and may hinder development efficiency. This approach often results in messy code that becomes difficult to refactor later on. I think we need to find a balance between code quality and development efficiency.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
Moving forward, I plan to adopt TDD in my projects, ensuring that my features are accompanied by sufficient test cases and are thoroughly tested before committing. Rather than focusing solely on writing the minimal code to pass tests, I aim to produce “good enough” code. This means giving more thought to the structure and implementation before development and grouping similar test cases in each commit.
